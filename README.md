========================


This is a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) starter project for ecommerce using [Snipcart](https://snipcart.com). It's configured to pull products data from [Flotiq](https://flotiq.com) and can be easily deployed to your cloud hosting - Heroku, Netlify, Gatsby Cloud, etc.

## Quick start

1. **Start project from template using Gatsby CLI**
    
    ```bash
    gatsby new gatsby-starter-products https://github.com/flotiq/gatsby-starter-products.git
    ```

1.  **Setup "Products" Content Type in Flotiq**

   Create your [Flotiq.com](https://editor.flotiq.com/register.html) account. 
   
   Next, create the `Product` Content Type:
   
   ![Create content type definition using Flotiq](docs/create-definition.png)
   
   _Note: You can also create `Product` using [Flotiq REST API](https://flotiq.com/docs/API/):_            
   
   ```sh
   curl 'https://api.flotiq.com/api/v1/internal/contenttype' -H 'X-AUTH-TOKEN: __YOUR_API_KEY__' -H 'Content-Type: application/json;chars--data-binary ' -X POST --data-binary '{"name":"product","label":"Product","schemaDefinition":{"type":"object","allOf":[{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/AbstractContentTypeSchemaDefinition"},{"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"slug":{"type":"string","minLength":1},"price":{"type":"number","minLength":1},"description":{"type":"string"},"productImage":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/DataSource"},"minItems":0},"productGallery":{"type":"array","items":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/DataSource"},"minItems":0}}}],"required":["name","slug","price"],"additionalProperties":false},"metaDefinition":{"propertiesConfig":{"name":{"inputType":"text","unique":true,"isTitlePart":true},"slug":{"inputType":"text","unique":true},"price":{"inputType":"number","unique":false},"description":{"inputType":"richtext","unique":false},"productImage":{"inputType":"datasource","unique":false,"validation":{"relationContenttype":"_media"}},"productGallery":{"inputType":"datasource","unique":false,"validation":{"relationMultiple":true,"relationContenttype":"_media"}}},"order":["name","slug","price","description","productImage","productGallery"]}}' --compressed
   ```
  
1.  **Configure application**

   The last step is to configure our application to know from where it has to fetch the data.
   You can also setup your Snipcart API_KEY to enable store functionality. 
   
   You need to create a file called `.env` inside the root of the directory, with the following structure:

   ```
   GATSBY_FLOTIQ_BASE_URL=https://api.flotiq.com
   GATSBY_FLOTIQ_API_KEY=YOUR FLOTIQ API KEY
   SNIPCART_API_KEY=YOUR SNIPCART PUBLIC API KEY
   ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.
    
    ```sh
    cd gatsby-starter-products
    npm install
    gatsby develop
    ```
      
    If you wish to import example products to your account, before running `gatsby develop` run:
      
    ```sh
    node ./example/importExample.js
    ```
    
    It will add 10 images and 4 products to your Flotiq account.
    
    _Note: You need to put your Read and write API key in `.env` for import to work. You don't need Product content type in your account. If you already have products with ids `product-1`, `product-2`, `product-3`, and `product-4` they will be overwritten._

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
    
    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._
    
    Open a project directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Manage your products using Flotiq editor**

    You can easily manage your products using Flotiq editor
